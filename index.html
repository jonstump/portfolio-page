    <h4>Skills</h4>
      <p>Here is a brief list of some of my skills</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Analysis</li>
        <li>SQL</li>
        <li>Time Management</li>
        <li>Speed Reading</li>
        <li>ETL Pipelines and Python</li>
        <li>Project Management including tools such as Lean, Agile,and Kanban</li>

    <h4>Why am I taking an Intro to Programming Class?</h4>
      <p>I am taking an intro to programming class for a few reasons:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>I would like to get into leadership. With the current need for programmers being around 2 Million just within the United States that means we will need more leaders to help organize and co-ordinate these new programmers.</li>
        <li>With every passing day programming is becoming a core skill that many people will need. I envision a day where many of us will have personal servers for our email and other tools for better privacy and control over our data.</li>
        <li>I always enjoy learning new things. While I have previously learned some coding with SQL and Python it was in an unstructured format. I wanted something that would keep me honest and push me forward with my learning.</li>
      </ol>

    <h4>Current Hobbies</h4>
    <p>I spend much of my free time bouncing between a handful of hobbies. One of my main hobbies is table top roleplaying games like Dungeons and Dragons which I have been playing for nearly twenty years. I also enjoy building gunpla models and playing video games as well.</p>
